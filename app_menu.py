Abegail E. Nonod is a first-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Main Campus. With a passion for organization and productivity, she chose to develop a task manager app as her final project in her Object-Oriented Programming course.

Abegail enjoys listing and organizing her tasks, which inspired her to create an app that reflects these habits. Her love for the color purple is clearly evident in the app's aesthetic. She's ready to learn more in order to improve this app.

Thank you for using Taskmate â€” Padayon!
