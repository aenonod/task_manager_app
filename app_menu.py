Abegail E. Nonod is a first-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering student at the Polytechnic University
of the Philippines - Main Campus. With a passion for organization and productivity, she chose to develop a task
manager app as her final project in her Object-Oriented Programming course.

Abegail enjoys listing and organizing her tasks, which inspired her to create an app that reflects these habits.
Her love for the color purple is clearly evident in the app's aesthetic. More than just a project, Taskmate is her
way of contributing to the development of useful tools that can help not only students but users from all walks
of life.

Thank you for using Taskmate â€” Padayon!
