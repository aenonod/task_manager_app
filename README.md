## task_manager_app

📁 Run main.py to run the whole program <br><br>
The task manager app prompts the user to choose between adding a task, viewing the task list, and marking a task done. Just like the other task management apps, it promotes productivity and an organized list of tasks.

Limitations:
* There is no autocorrect feature, so the user should double-check the spelling of their inputs.
* Users cannot delete or remove a task (as of now) once it's been entered, but can mark it if done.
* Lack of visual display.
